# GA4GH Technical Alignment Sub Committee (TASC) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry/develop/LICENSE)

The Tech Alignment Sub-Committee (TASC) Team provides mechanisms and recommendations to create internal consistency and technical alignment across GA4GH Work Streams and deliverables.

GA4GH aims to balance agility with mechanisms that will allow our teams to develop an interconnected suite of standards and reduce the burden of repeated internal landscape analyses. The alignment-focused Sub-Committee of the GA4GH Steering Committee TASC will function as a central decision-making group, including the documentation and communication of these decisions across multiple stakeholders.

The collective resources in the TASC will help inform the peer review of standards inside of GA4GH but do not by themselves mandate adoption. The benefit of participating in the interoperable GA4GH suite of standards, rather, would drive uptake.

## TASC members
TASC consists of at least 1 volunteer representative from each Work Stream from members of the Steering Committee or a proxy nominated by the SC member, representing multiple countries and organizations.
